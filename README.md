A simple application for Knowing Central Limit Theorem

This application is to give a simple example of the central limit theorem. Displaying how random variables from exponential random distribution approximate to the normal distribution. Here we use the exponential distribution with rate 1. We provide different settings of samples and observations. You can choose any combination between number of samples and observations.
